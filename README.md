- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ulf94, my name is Michal
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (obviously ;) ), handball (big fan of VIVE Lomza Kielce) and football (even bigger fan of FC Bayern Munchen). One of my biggest achievements  is being an honored blood donator ! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .Net, C# and Angular (ASP.NET Core in general). I'm a PLC programmer for more than 2 years already.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to ASP.NET Core, I'd like to improve my skills in that area.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Just go to - https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalszura361427154/
